# LANG
LANG is a natural language understanding model that uses physical simulations to understand and infer new information from short english expressions. LANG was developed in C# and the Unity Game Developement Environment. LANG uses words to construct a complete world model of objects, states and events. By observing this world model, it is able to infer new information that allows it to reason about time, space, position, sequence, motion, size and other concepts.  Since the model only uses words as  means to point to what they represent, its language representation is neither symbolic nor vectorized.


Here's a video demonstrating LANG working through a few of the challenges from the FACEBOOK bAbI question answering dataset:
