# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I'm a lecturer and researcher in structural engineering and computational sciences at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology with an interest in  Artificial General Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Most of my research focuses on developing novel natural language understanding models that incorporate and extract world knowledge into language. When I'm not working, I sketch stuff, make video games and read non-fiction.
