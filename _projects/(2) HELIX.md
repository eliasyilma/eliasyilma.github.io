# HELIX
Helix is a structural optimization software that uses genetic algorithms to design cost efficient reinforced concrete buildings. The program consists of four main components: a structural analysis program for computing the internal forces and moments inside a potential structure, a genetic algorithm framework for simulating processes involving evolution, a structural fitness function evaluator for assessing the cost, strength and other parameters of a potential structural design, a graphical user interface for user interaction and displaying results.
